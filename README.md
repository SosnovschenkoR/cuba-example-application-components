# Example for using CUBA application components

This is an example project that shows the features of application components in CUBA 6.10. It contains three CUBA projects:

* appointments - an application component that contains certain business logic as a seperate unit
* project-management-platform - an application component which provides certain base classes or common shared code
* project-management-app - the application that uses both components in different parts of its own business code
